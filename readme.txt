You must include a new file, readme.txt, which must include the following components:

A short description of the project's name and what it does. This may be taken from your design docs.

How to run the project. For example, which file the user should run in an editor. If your project uses data/source files, also describe how the user should set those up.

Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist. Shortcut commands can be used to demonstrate specific features by skipping forward in a game or loading sample data. They're useful for when you're testing your code too!

Update: Which fonts you're using that need to be installed, if any. These fonts should be listed by their specific name. This includes any custom fonts or fonts that may not be downloaded on users' files. If you can include the installation file (.ttf or .otf) in the submission, that is preferred.

A competent programmer should be able to run your project after reading the readme file, so make sure to include all necessary files in your submission!
